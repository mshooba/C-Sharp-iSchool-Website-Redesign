This project is a C#-based web application that retrieves and displays information from a REST API. The UI components used in this project are:

### Bootstrap
- `Tabs`
- `Grid System (cards)`

## JQueryUI
- `Accordion`
- `DataTable`

### FancyBox
- `Modal`



These components were obtained from the official documentation of Bootstrap, JQueryUI and FancyBox


- Use of the expando object to display course lists with clickable buttons. Research into a sleek looking plugin to display course information.
- Learning a bit of typescript to be able to use the Fancybox plugin.
- Splash Page Design, overall look and feel. Attention to detail for visual design / typography / user experience.
- Partial Navigation view - created a model and separate Navigation.cshtml to add an active class to the navbar.
- Custom CSS instead of using a JQueryUI theme.
